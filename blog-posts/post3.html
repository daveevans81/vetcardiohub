<p>Has your vet recommended an “echo” for your pet? Wondering what it
involves? Or maybe you need one yourself and found this post by chance?
Either way, the information here applies to both human and veterinary
cardiology!</p>
<p>An “echo” is shorthand for <strong>echocardiogram</strong>, a
specialized ultrasound scan of the heart. It uses <strong>high-frequency
sound waves</strong>—far beyond what humans or animals can hear—to
create real-time images of the heart in motion.</p>
<p>Technically, <strong>any</strong> ultrasound image is an “echo,” but
in medicine and veterinary care, the term is usually reserved for heart
scans.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="why-perform-an-echo"><strong>Why Perform an Echo?</strong></h2>
<p>We love echocardiograms because they give <strong>far more
information</strong> about the heart than most other tests. Instead of
just guessing based on symptoms or electrical activity, we can actually
<strong>see the heart in action</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="what-can-an-echo-show"><strong>What Can an Echo
Show?</strong></h3>
<p>A high-quality echocardiogram provides a <strong>detailed
look</strong> inside the heart, including:</p>
<p>✅ The size of each heart chamber (left atrium/ventricle, right
atrium/ventricle)<br />
✅ How well the heart is contracting (<strong>systolic
function</strong>)<br />
✅ Abnormalities in heart walls (thickening, thinning, scars,
infarction, or even tumors)<br />
✅ How well the heart valves are moving and functioning<br />
✅ Signs of blood abnormalities (clots, coagulation)<br />
✅ Rarely, even <strong>parasites like heartworm!</strong></p>
<h3 id="doppler-the-magic-of-measuring-blood-flow"><strong>Doppler: The
Magic of Measuring Blood Flow</strong></h3>
<p>Doppler ultrasound adds another dimension by detecting <strong>blood
movement</strong>. Using sound waves, it can measure:</p>
<p>🔹 <strong>Normal blood flow</strong> through heart chambers &amp;
valves<br />
🔹 <strong>Leaky valves</strong> (regurgitation)<br />
🔹 <strong>Narrowed or blocked valves</strong><br />
🔹 <strong>Abnormal blood flow</strong> due to heart defects (e.g.,
shunting between chambers)</p>
<p>An ECG (electrocardiogram) is often run
<strong>simultaneously</strong> to help with timing and rhythm
assessment.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="thats-a-lot-of-information"><strong>That’s a Lot of
Information!</strong></h2>
<p>Right? A complete echocardiogram involves capturing multiple
<strong>video loops</strong> of the heart beating from various angles.
This lets us fully assess heart structure and function.</p>
<p>Advanced techniques—such as <strong>3D imaging, transesophageal
scans, tissue Doppler, and AI-assisted analysis</strong>—are being
developed but aren’t always necessary in veterinary cases.</p>
<hr />
<img src="echomachine_sm.jpg" alt="Echo machine">
<h2 id="who-should-perform-the-echo-on-my-pet"><strong>Who Should
Perform the Echo on My Pet?</strong></h2>
<p>Not all echocardiograms are equal! The <strong>skill of the
operator</strong> and the <strong>quality of the ultrasound
machine</strong> greatly affect the results.</p>
<h3 id="choosing-the-right-professional"><strong>Choosing the Right
Professional</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>human medicine</strong>, trained echocardiographers
follow strict accreditation standards.</li>
<li>In <strong>veterinary medicine</strong>, formal accreditation is
still developing. (As of 2025, consensus guidelines are still being
finalized.)</li>
<li>Ideally, look for a <strong>specialist cardiologist</strong> with a
<strong>diploma or advanced practitioner status</strong> for the most
detailed and accurate scan.</li>
</ul>
<p>General veterinarians may perform <strong>basic
echocardiograms</strong>, but their level of detail often varies. If
your vet suggests an echo, ask:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>Who will perform it?</strong><br />
✔ <strong>What is their experience level?</strong><br />
✔ <strong>Would a specialist provide better insights?</strong></p>
<p>It’s common for a <strong>general vet to perform an initial
scan</strong> and then refer to a specialist if the case is complex.
However, specialist scans do come at a <strong>higher cost</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-during-an-echo"><strong>What Happens During an
Echo?</strong></h2>
<h3 id="the-procedure"><strong>The Procedure</strong></h3>
<p>📌 Your pet is usually <strong>positioned on a special table</strong>
with a cut-out section, allowing the ultrasound probe to be placed under
their chest.<br />
📌 <strong>Helpers hold them still and reassure them</strong> during the
scan.<br />
📌 <strong>Shaving a small area</strong> on the chest allows better
ultrasound contact.<br />
📌 <strong>ECG leads</strong> (pads or clips) are attached to monitor
the heart’s rhythm.</p>
<p>For <strong>large dogs</strong>, the scan may be performed
<strong>while standing</strong>, which can be more challenging.</p>
<h3 id="will-my-pet-need-sedation"><strong>Will My Pet Need
Sedation?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Many pets tolerate echocardiograms <strong>without
sedation</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Cats are more likely to need mild sedation</strong> than
dogs.</li>
<li>We use gentle handling and calming techniques first to avoid
unnecessary sedation.</li>
</ul>
<img src="lickmat_sm.jpg" alt="Using a lickmat during echo">
<hr />
<h2 id="how-long-does-it-take"><strong>How Long Does It
Take?</strong></h2>
<p>⌛ <strong>20–30 minutes</strong> to capture images.<br />
⌛ <strong>Another 20–30 minutes</strong> to measure and interpret
results.</p>
<p>This depends on the <strong>patient’s cooperation</strong>. If they
are <strong>very wiggly or anxious</strong>, it can take longer.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="when-will-i-get-the-results"><strong>When Will I Get the
Results?</strong></h2>
<p>📊 The images are available <strong>instantly</strong>, and most
veterinary cardiologists will discuss findings <strong>on the same
day</strong>.</p>
<p>However, some clinics <strong>review cases with a higher-level
specialist</strong>, which may cause a slight delay.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="final-thoughts"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3>
<p>An echocardiogram is <strong>one of the most powerful tools</strong>
for assessing heart health in pets. If your vet recommends one, knowing
what to expect—and who is performing it—will help you make the best
decision for your pet’s care.</p>
