“How to Check Your Pet’s Sleeping Respiratory Rate”
Hi, and welcome to VetCardioHub. Today, we’re talking about something simple, but powerful— Measuring your pet’s Sleeping Respiratory Rate, or SRR.
SRR means the number of breaths your dog or cat takes per minute, While they’re asleep.
 
Why is that important?
Because this number can give you an early warning sign of heart disease, Especially congestive heart failure.
And the best part? You can check it yourself—right at home.
Let me show you how:
 
 
When your pet is sound asleep— Not just lying down, but truly sleeping—
Set a timer on your phone and  Watch their chest go up and down.
 
One breath is one rise and one fall. Count those breaths for 30 seconds, Then double that number.
Now you’ve got their breaths per minute—their SRR.
It’s that simple.
To get the most reliable results:
	•	Make sure your pet is fully asleep.
	•	Don’t check while they’re panting, purring, or moving.
	•	And take the measurement 2 or 3 times, a few minutes apart.
 
Lets have a look at an example. 
Here you can see a sleeping cat, my own of course! 
He has kindly stretched himself out which makes it easier to see the chest and abdominal movements. 
 
As you can see, the movement of each breath is most obvious at the end of the rib cage where it becomes the abdomen, although this varies with posture. 
In out, in out, in out. As you can see a pause happens after the outbreath. 
But the main thing is not to double count the in and out. 
One breath is one rise and one fall.
 
Still with me? It is simple right?
 
Now—what’s normal?
For healthy dogs and cats, A normal SRR is usually between 15 and 30 breaths per minute.
If it’s consistently above 30, That’s a reason to call your vet.
And if it reaches 40 or more, That could be urgent. Call your vet right away.
 
 
You can also use a free app like Cardalis To help you record the numbers and share them with your vet. It helps a lot with the timing aspect of all this, as you can tell you have to look very carefully at your pet to see the breathes, so you can’t be trying to watch a second hand as well.
It also handles the counting – don’t forget you may be doing this when you’re pretty tired yourself!! Super handy.
 
So—why does this number matter so much?
When a pet’s heart isn’t pumping properly, Fluid can build up in the lungs or around the lungs. This makes it harder to breathe—especially when they’re resting.
That’s called congestive heart failure. And an increased SRR is often the first sign it’s happening.
Earlier than coughing. Earlier than even an X-ray or scan might detect.
 
Now—about coughing. Yes, it can be related to heart problems, But it’s not always a clear sign.
That’s why SRR is so useful— It’s a more reliable signal, And it’s easy to monitor at home.
 
Also look out for other changes— Like appetite, energy levels, or behavior. Cats especially can hide signs of illness really well.
 
What about panting?
Dogs pant instead of sweating. 
They do it whenever they are hot, stressed, anxious or in pain
Just like situations that make us sweaty.
It doesn’t usually mean there is a heart problem, although of course some heart problems can cause anxiety. Especially arrhythmias.
Either way, if your pet is panting a lot and there is no good reason like a hot night, 
Then best to discuss with your vet. 
But it probably isn’t a sign of congestive heart failure 
-unless the sleeping respiratory rate is also high.
 
So, what should you do if the SRR is high?
If it’s above 30 repeatedly, Or it spikes to 40 or more— Or if your pet just seems unwell— Call your vet. Don’t wait.
And if it’s outside regular hours, Contact an emergency clinic.
 
So –
Checking your pet’s SRR is quick, easy, and potentially lifesaving. It helps you catch heart issues early— Before they become serious. And it gives your vet valuable info to guide treatment.
So, make it a habit. And stay on top of your pet’s heart health.
 
This is particularly true if your cardiologist thinks your pet could be close to heart failure, or if your pet is already on diuretics to treat heart failure, this could be a lifesaver.
 
If your pet is already on diuretics and their SRR starts climbing – its probably time to give more. Talk to your vet urgently.

Video Script: Monitoring Sleeping Respiratory Rate in Dogs and Cats
Title: How to Check Your Pet’s Sleeping Respiratory Rate (SRR) – A Lifesaving Habit Estimated Length: ~5 minutes

[Opening Frame: VetCardioHub Logo + soft background music]
Narrator (voiceover or on camera): Hi, and welcome to VetCardioHub — where we help you stay informed and confident about your pet’s heart health.
Today, we're talking about something simple, quick, and incredibly powerful — measuring your pet’s sleeping respiratory rate, or SRR.

[Scene: Calm sleeping dog or cat]
Narrator: So, what is SRR? SRR stands for Sleeping Respiratory Rate — that’s the number of breaths your dog or cat takes per minute while they’re asleep.
It might sound small, but this number can give early warning signs of heart disease, especially congestive heart failure, or CHF.

[Scene: Owner watching pet sleep, smiling]
Narrator: Here’s how to measure it.
Watch your pet’s chest as it rises and falls. One full breath includes both an inhale and an exhale. Count how many full breaths they take in 30 seconds, then double that number. That gives you their breaths per minute.
Simple, right?

[Scene: Pet in cozy bed, peaceful room]
Narrator: To get the most accurate result:
	•	Make sure your pet is fully asleep, not just resting.
	•	Pick a moment when they’re calm and quiet.
	•	Avoid measuring if they’re panting, purring, or snoring.
For consistency, repeat the measurement 2 or 3 times, a few minutes apart. Then take an average.

[Scene: Screen recording of Cardalis App or animated icons of a phone and app interface]
Narrator: Want help keeping track? There’s a free app called the Cardalis App, available on iOS and Android. It helps you record the numbers, track trends, and even share data directly with your vet.

[Scene: Graph with "Normal SRR: 15–25" and "Concern: >30 / Urgent: >40"]
Narrator: So, what’s normal?
For healthy dogs and cats, it’s typically 15 to 25 breaths per minute.
If your pet’s SRR is consistently over 30, it’s worth a chat with your vet. If it’s 40 or more, or your pet seems unwell or struggling, that’s a red flag. Call your vet immediately.
Remember: Changes over time are often more important than a single number. That’s why tracking is so useful.

[Scene: Heart diagram animation with fluid buildup – pulmonary edema & pleural effusion]
Narrator: Why does this matter?
In congestive heart failure, fluid can build up in or around the lungs, making it harder to breathe. This is known as:
	•	Pulmonary oedema – fluid in the lungs
	•	Pleural effusion – fluid around the lungs
And guess what? An elevated SRR is often the first sign of this happening — even before X-rays or ultrasounds pick it up.

[Scene: Dog coughing, then transitioning to sleeping pet again]
Narrator: You might wonder, what about coughing?
Coughing can be linked to heart disease — like from an enlarged heart — but not always. That’s why SRR is so useful. It’s more specific, and it’s easy to measure at home.
Also keep an eye on your pet’s appetite, energy levels, or any changes in behavior — especially in cats, who tend to hide symptoms.

[Scene: Pet owner calling vet, friendly clinic staff answering]
Narrator: If your pet’s SRR is high — especially over 30 or hitting 40 — or if they’re just not themselves, don’t wait. Call your vet. And if it’s after hours, reach out to an emergency clinic.

[Scene: Owner checking pet, then cuddling on couch]
Narrator: To wrap up:
Regularly checking your pet’s SRR is a simple habit with a huge impact. It helps you catch heart problems early, monitor treatment, and ensure your pet gets the care they need — when they need it.
