About Maven Pet Maven Pet is a smart health tracker for cats and dogs, co-created with veterinarians and clinically validated. Unlike GPS trackers, Maven focuses on health. Our smart collar and app monitor activity, rest, heart rate, respiratory rate, itch behaviors, and (for dogs) water intake, helping pet parents spot illness early and act sooner. The result: healthier pets and peace of mind.
As an affiliate, you’ll promote a subscription product that solves a real problem: pets can’t tell us when something is wrong. Maven provides real-time health insights.
