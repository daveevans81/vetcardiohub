Does your dog sound like they’re trying to clear their throat,
Or are they making a weird retching noise…
Or are they obviously coughing
You’re not alone.
Coughing in pets can be concerning — but is it always serious?
And more importantly… is it the heart?
This can be particularly worrying if you already know, or suspect, that your pet has heart disease.
 
So I’m Dave, a veterinary cardiologist with 20 years of experience And today I want to help answer the question I get all the time in practice:
“Is coughing a sign of heart disease?”
 
 
Let’s find out.
 
 
💡 What Is a Cough, Anyway?
A cough is your pet’s way of clearing their airways.
It’s actually a reflex triggered by tiny sensors sitting mostly in the upper airways —
designed to kick out irritants like dust, mucus, smoke, or even tiny foreign objects.
 
So we get:
1.             A Big breath in.
2.             The Vocal cords shut tight.
3.             The Chest squeezes. 
4.             The cords open up suddenly - And whoosh — air bursts out to clear the problem. 
This explosive opening of the vocal cords causes a harsh sound - the cough
 
But… here’s a very little know fact, did you know there are actually two different kinds of coughs? Its worth knowing the difference
 
🔍 The Two Cough Reflexes
Cough Reflex — the classic deep breath, then big push.
This usually comes from deeper in the chest — the trachea or bronchi.
It’s how the body clears built-up secretions lower in the airway.
It’s a more typical cough sound but actually seems to be much less common on dogs than number 2
 
Which is the Expiratory Reflex —
That sharp little “huff” or gag noise.
It’s triggered higher up, near the voice box,
And it doesn’t need a deep breath first.
This kind is especially common in dogs with airway irritation or kennel cough, or even aging changes in the airways which is a super common problem as dogs get older.
And it’s often mistaken for vomiting or choking.
It seems to be really common in older dogs too particular after resting, 
Likely as a throat clearing mechanism getting rid of built up secretions.
 
 
🔍 Why This Matters
These two types of reflexes tell us where the problem might be.
•               A deep, moist cough? Might be coming from the lungs or lower airways.
•               A gagging cough or retch? Likely from the throat or upper airway.
That’s why coughing can sound so different — and why it’s so confusing for pet owners.
Even experienced vets can’t always tell what’s going on just from hearing it.
And when it comes to heart disease, we can get both types of cough. Stay tuned to find out more.
 
 
🐶 So why do dogs cough?
Dogs cough a lot more often when they are older, mainly due to upper airway weakness and chronic inflammation.
 
As well as age, size and breed make some difference too, with smaller dogs being more prone to airway weakness issues
 
The most common causes of cough include:
•               Kennel cough (a contagious airway infection)
•               Chronic bronchitis
•               Airway collapse
•               Heart enlargement, where an enlarged heart presses on nearby airways
 
So yes, many dogs, but especially Small breed dogs — jj
often develop mitral valve disease as they age.
Their heart becomes enlarged and pushes on the mainstem bronchi — triggering a cough.
 
So yes — in dogs, a heart problem can absolutely cause coughing.
But it’s only one possibility.
 
As a lot of these types of problem are chronic, they can often happen together.
                  
 
 
❤️ Is Coughing a Sign of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)?
 
Not necessarily.
CHF happens when fluid builds up in or around the lungs.
This makes breathing harder — but it doesn’t always trigger a cough.
 
Why not?
Because the deep parts of the lungs, where fluid builds up in CHF,
have very few cough receptors.
So many dogs or cats in full heart failure don’t actually cough.
Instead, they breathe faster — even when resting.
 
You likely already know if your pet is at risk of congestive heart failure, 
as your vet will probably have heard a heart murmur for a while 
before it is likely to develop CHF. 
If your pet hasn’t had a check up for a long time, 
this might be a good wake up call.
 
If they do have a heart murmur, 
hopefully your vet will have given you some advice already about what to watch for.
If not, 
my recommendation is always to get an echocardiogram done ideally by a cardiologist
so you know for sure what the heart murmur is being caused by 
and get ahead of the problem.
And if they haven’t mentioned it, 
ask them whether you should be counting 
something called the sleeping respiratory rate.
 
 
🫁 So… What’s a More Reliable Sign Than Coughing?
Sleeping Respiratory Rate — or SRR.
This is the number of breaths your pet takes per minute,
while they’re fully asleep.
Its very easy to do.
And it doesn’t cost anything
And it only takes 30 seconds
 
More than 30 breaths per minute at rest is a possible red flag —
especially in pets with known heart disease.
 
If you haven’t seen our video on SRR, I’ll link it at the end and below.
SRR is one of the best early warning signs of worsening heart failure.
LEARNING TO MONITOR IT CAN GENUINELY SAVE YOUR PET’S LIFE
 
 
🩺 Other Causes of Coughing to Consider
Let’s not forget the many non-heart causes. My full list would be:
•               Infections: like kennel cough or pneumonia. This can be viral, bacterial or even fungal.
•               Foreign bodies: like grass seeds
•               Allergies or irritants
•               Airway collapse, weakness or scarring
•               Asthma – usually rare in dogs though
•               Lung cancer — rare, but serious
If the cough is worsening,
or your pet is also losing weight,
or showing signs of lethargy or appetite changes —
it’s definitely time to talk to your vet.
 
Otherwise if your pet is well in themselves, with no obvious other problems, then check the sleeping respiratory rate, and if its normal then its ok to give the cough a bit of time to see if its improving or worsening. Remember though, this is generic educational information and you should always consider seeking proper advice from a professional
 
🚨 When to Seek Veterinary Help
You should call your vet if:
•               Your pet has known heart disease and a new cough
•               Their breathing is fast, laboured, or sounds wheezy, ESPECIALLY IF THE SLEEPING RESPIRATORY RATE IS ELEVATED
•               The cough is persistent, sudden, or getting worse
•               If your pet is unwell in other ways, as we’ve just discussed
•               Or you’re just unsure — it’s always okay to ask. Even emergency vets are usually happy to give some triage advice over the phone so don’t hesitate to call if you are worried.
 
Getting a diagnosis may require:
•               A physical exam
•               X-rays
•               Bloodwork
•               And sometimes even ultrasound or bronchoscopy
Of course, a diagnosis can be elusive. 
Coughs can be due to multiple reasons. 
Sometimes the conditions above kind of add up together 
to cross the threshold of irritating those little cough sensors we mentioned before. 
Also the lungs are deep in the body 
and don’t like to be messed around too much, 
so tests are either non-specific (like imaging) 
or invasive (like bronchoscopy and airway washes). 
So I do see an awful lot of guesswork going on from vets sometimes in my role, 
And that’s absolutely ok as long as they are explaining their process to you
And giving you the options of investigating further
 
✅ Final Thoughts
So — is coughing always a heart problem?
No. But sometimes… it is.
That’s why we look at the whole picture:
•               Breathing rate and effort
•               Overall energy
•               Appetite
•               And any known medical history
•               
Coughing isn’t something to panic about —
But it’s also not something to ignore.
 
If in doubt — check SRR. Then call your vet.
