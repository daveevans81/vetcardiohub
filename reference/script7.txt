Script: How to Use the Cardalis App to Count Your Pet’s Breathing
[Intro]
 Hello, and welcome. In this video I’ll show you how to use the 
Cardalis app to count your pet’s breathing at home.
 
Why would you want to do that?  
Well, this is one of the most useful ways you can help your vet 
monitor your pet’s heart condition
 
Don’t worry — it’s simple, and the app will guide you through it step by step.

[Step 1: Download and Open the App]
 First, download the free Cardalis app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.
 Once installed, open the app. 
The first time you use it, 
you need to set up your pet, 
so go to ‘My Dogs’
 
Select ‘Add a dog’ and you can add your dog in here, 

you can have more than one and keep track of them all. 

Include your vet’s name and email address if you wish. 
Make sure to add a cute picture at this point also.
 
 
And yes, it all works great for cats too, the target breathing rate is the same and everything. 
The app may seem a bit prejudiced, but I love all species equally!
 
Now you’re ready to begin. select “Monitor.” And get where you can see your pet sleeping.
 

[Step 2: Choosing the Right Time]
 The best time to measure is when your pet is asleep or resting quietly — never when they’re excited, playing, or just after exercise.
 You’re looking for their sleeping respiratory rate, or SRR. This is the most accurate and reliable measurement. 
 
Some dogs and cats sleep deeper than others, you’ll have to find what works best for your pet over time. Don’t do it if they are panting, or dreaming as this will cause problems.
 

[Step 3: Counting Breaths 
 When your pet is settled, start the timer in the app.
 Watch your pet’s chest or flanks rise and fall — that’s one breath.  
Tap the button in the app each time your pet breathes in and out. 
Its best to pick one point in the breathing cycle and always count at that point
 The app will keep track for you and calculate the breathing rate per minute.
 
If your pet moves, wakes up, or pants, stop the timer with the ‘reset’ button 
and wait until they’re asleep again before trying another reading.
 
Lets have a look at an example:
Here’s my cat having a snooze. Get a feeling for the rhythm of the respiratory cycle. And then count the breathing
 

[Step 4: Saving] At the end of the count of 30 seconds, 
the app will give you your pet’s breathing rate in breaths per minute.
 You can save the result with the date and time, and even set reminders to measure regularly.
 This record is really helpful for us cardiologists — 
it allows us to spot changes early and adjust treatment if needed.
 

[Step 5: When to Contact Your Vet  A normal sleeping breathing rate is usually under 30 breaths per minute for most dogs and cats.
 If you notice your pet’s breathing rate is consistently higher than this, 
or if it suddenly increases, please get in touch with your vet straight away.
 
You can even modify the target rate in the app. 
This is rarely needed, but some pets do seem to have naturally 
higher breathing rates 
so getting to know their ‘normal’ rate is most important of all.
 
How often to do it?
Discuss with your vet how often you should be checking. 
Usually I recommend about 3 times a week, 
but doing it every day for around 10 days is best
 after any changes in your pet’s health or medication doses.

[Outro] That’s all there is to it 
— download the Cardalis app, 
measure when your pet is resting, 
and record the results.
 It only takes a minute a day, but it provides us with incredibly valuable information to keep your pet as healthy as possible
. Thank you for taking the time to help us care for your pet’s heart.

and what congestive heart failure means
