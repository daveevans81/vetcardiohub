So - Has your vet told you your dog has a heart murmur?
 
Is it serious? Should you be worried?
 
Well, you're in the right place! I'm Dr Dave Evans, a veterinarian with 20 years of experience and cardiology advanced practitioner, and today, I’ll break down what heart murmurs are, what causes them, and what you should do if your pet has one!
 
So, maybe you took your dog to the vet, and they told you that they have a heart murmur. Hopefully they managed to explain this a little bit, but often time is too short to fully cover this complex subject. Lets have  a look at what this really means.

[SECTION 1 – What is a Heart Murmur? (0:20-1:30)] [🎵 Background music fades] (Close-up of you speaking with visuals appearing on-screen)
 
The actual cause of a heart murmur can be tricky to understand. It’s based on the transition of fluid flow from laminar, or smooth flow, into turbulent flow. I like the anaology of a river. Have you even looked at a large river - flowing past often at great speed and volume and noticed how completely silent it normally is? its quite remarkable when you think on it, that huge volume of flow moving so quietly. However as soon as it reaches a constriction or narrowing like a bridge or rapids, suddenly it can become really loud. The physics of this are pretty complex, but basically the rapid and irregular pressure and velocity changes within the turbulent flow are generating sound waves.
 
In the same way, a heart murmur is caused by turbulent blood flow in the heart. Anything that affects the smooth flowing of the blood through each of the 4 cardiac chambers and valves and great vessels will result in a chaotic or swirling motion in the blood and this changes the flow from silent to noisy.
 
"A heart murmur is an abnormal sound that we hear when listening to your dog's heart with a stethoscope. Normally, a dog’s heart sounds like a steady ‘lub-dub, lub-dub.’ But with a murmur, we hear a whooshing or swishing sound."
 
Lets listen to an example. Here is a recording of a heart beating normally….
 
And here is one with a typical type of heart murmur we hear, known as a systolic murmur:

Key takeaways on-screen:
	•	"Murmur = abnormal heart sound"
	•	"Whooshing noise instead of lub-dub"
	•	"Caused by turbulent blood flow"

[SECTION 2 – What Causes Heart Murmurs? (1:30-3:00)] [🎵 Soft music under voice]
 
So there are lots of reasons that you can get a heart murmur. 
 
 
Some are innocent murmurs, which means they’re harmless and often found in puppies. They usually go away as the puppy grows. Other types of benign murmurs can appear in young, fit, athletic dogs especially when they’re a little bit stressed at the vets. Some cardiologists call these flow murmurs.

However, murmurs can also be caused by underlying heart disease, including:"
 
	•	Congenital heart defects: Some dogs are born with abnormal heart structures. So not all puppies with murmurs should be assumed to have an innocent murmur.
 
	•	Leaky heart valves: The most common cause in older dogs, especially small breeds like Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and chihuahuas, but we see this in nearly all breeds to some extent.
 
 
	•	Heart muscle disease: Larger breeds, like Dobermans, can develop conditions like dilated cardiomyopathy.
 
	•	Other conditions: Things like anemia or infections can also contribute."

Heart murmur grading:
Your vet might have also mentioned a grade or level when they heard the murmur. 

[SECTION 3 – Symptoms to Watch For (3:00-4:00)]
 
what signs should you look out for at home? 
 
Now, here’s the important part—A heart murmur itself isn’t always a problem, but it can indicate underlying heart disease. 
 
Often this murmur is like an early warning signal going off. And this is fortunate, because many heart conditions are much better diagnosed early. These days there are options for preventative treatments and surgical fixes for lots of  conditions.
 
So even if your pet is showing no symptoms at all, it is well worth discussing options with your vet, and making sure they are giving it due consideration.
 
However, if your pet is showing any of these symptoms, it is even more important to get them checked out:
 
[🖼️ On-screen: List of symptoms with matching pet footage]
	•	Coughing, especially at night or after exercise.
	•	Lethargy and reduced activity.
	•	Rapid or difficulty breathing, especially a sleeping respiratory rate over 30
	•	Fainting or collapse.
	•	Decreased appetite or weight loss.
 
Measuring your dog’s sleeping respiratory rate is one of the best ways to look for concerning signs. I’ll have an detailed guide on how to do this in the description below.

[SECTION 4 – Diagnosing Heart Murmurs (4:00-5:00)]
"When we detect a murmur, the next step is to determine how serious it is. This can be done in several ways:
[🖼️ On-screen: Vet performing an exam]
	•	An echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart to see how well it's functioning.
	•	A chest X-ray to check the heart’s size and lung health.
	•	Blood tests to rule out other health issues,and possibly to screen for markers that could suggest cardiac problems.
	•	An ECG – if your vet suspects any rhythm disturbances
 
Of course its really important to use your own vet’s guidance on this one, as there are so many different possible situations that can apply. 
 
My favourite starting point, nearly every time, is an echo. This is because it provides so much more information than any other test, on the right machine and in the right hands. 
 
In fact an expert echo is able to give a cardiologist a view of every chamber of the heart moving dynamically and to assess the speed and flow characteristics through every valve and vessel. And to assess if any of the valves are leaking – known as regurgitation. Here is an example of what your vet will be seeing.
 
So remember, not all murmurs are life-threatening, but early detection is key to managing heart health!

[SECTION 5 – Treatment and Management (5:00-6:30)]
 
"Treatment for heart murmurs depends on the cause. Some murmurs need no treatment at all, while others may require medication to support heart function, such as:"
 
[🖼️ On-screen: Medication bottles & prescription pad]
	•	Pimobendan: A medication to boost the heart’s pump function
	•	Diuretics: To reduce fluid buildup.
	•	ACE inhibitors: To help blood flow more easily.
 
In fact over recent years we have found an increasing number of conditions that can be delayed by bringing in medication in the pre-clinical – or asymptomatic – phase. So this is why its usually worth getting a murmur investigated before you see any changes in your dogs health.
 
In some parts of the world now, surgical interventions to fix some heart conditions are becoming more possible. This includes minimally invasive catheter techniques, usually used on various congenital abnormalities, as you can see here. 
And even  open heart surgery is now becoming increasingly available, although this is still a rarity. In the UK we currently are lucky enough to have one centre that is pioneering this approach.
 

[SECTION 6 – What Can You Do as a Pet Owner? (6:30-7:30)]
"If your dog has been diagnosed with a heart murmur, don’t panic! Here’s what you can do:"
 
[🖼️ On-screen: Dog owner checklist]
 
	•	Follow your vet’s advice on diagnosis and monitoring. In particular try to get an echocardiogram performed by someone with expertise in this area. 
	•	Keep up with regular check-ups and heart screenings.
	•	Make regular recordings of the sleeping respiratory rate
	•	Make note of any changes in energy levels.
	•	Ensure your dog maintains a healthy weight and diet."
 
"By staying proactive, you can help your pet live a happy and healthy life! And remember, regular check-ups are crucial to monitor any changes over time!
 

[CONCLUSION – Call to Action (7:30-8:00)] [🎵 Upbeat music returns]
"Heart murmurs can sound scary, but with the right care, many dogs can lead normal lives. I expect the majority of dogs coming into my clinics to be living for several years still after diagnosis.
