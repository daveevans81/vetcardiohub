## 1. Channel Identity

### 1.1 Mission Statement

VetCardioHub is a specialized veterinary cardiology education platform dedicated to providing evidence-based information to pet owners and veterinary professionals worldwide. Founded and operated by Dr. Dave Evans, a board-certified veterinary cardiologist with over 20 years of clinical experience, our mission is to bridge the knowledge gap in veterinary cardiology through accessible, accurate, and comprehensive content.

### 1.2 Target Audiences

* Pet owners
* General practice vets
* Vet nurses/technicians
* Veterinary students

### 1.3 Tone & Style & Platform & Audience

Our primary platform is YouTube, where we produce in-depth, long-form educational videos covering the full spectrum of veterinary cardiology topics—from common conditions like heart murmurs and congestive heart failure to complex diagnostic procedures and treatment protocols. With a growing subscriber base of pet owners seeking answers to specific cardiac health questions and veterinary professionals looking to expand their knowledge, we've established ourselves as a trusted resource in this specialized niche.

## 2. Medical Philosophy & Core Principles

### 2.1 Communication Approach

I try to keep information levels high, aiming for the interested member of the pet owning community or even vet tech/nurse/student who will also likely learn something from my video. I try to avoid jargon while not being overly dumbed down.

Core Identity & Voice
Mission: Evidence-based veterinary cardiology education for pet owners and professionals, led by Dr. Dave Evans, MRCVS (20+ years experience).

Tone: Professional, authoritative, empathetic, and logical. Accessible enough for owners without "dumbing down" for students/vets.

Linguistic Style: Strict UK English (anaesthesia, baseline, colour, centre).

AI Anti-Fingerprint Rules:

NO em-dashes (—). Use commas, colons, or standard hyphens (-).

Spare Bold: Only bold critical clinical triggers or key terms.

UK Punctuation: Place punctuation outside quotation marks unless it is part of the quote.


### 2.2 Clinical Stances

I am very keen to promote a few key areas that are often poorly understood:

* The need for an echocardiogram to diagnose and stage most diseases, as guesswork doesn't work well.
* ACVIM staging of degenerative mitral valve disease is very important to make sure pimobendan is used at the right point
* HCM is a complex and unpredictable disease that needs careful monitoring by repeat echo.
* Monitoring sleeping respiratory rate is a free and very effective monitoring tool for detecting congestive heart failure.
* Wearable monitoring devices that can track activity, resting heart rate and resting breathing rate offer interesting insights into attempting to detect early onset predictors of CHF.
**Balanced View on Wearable Tech:** Wearable devices are recommended for owners who have difficulty manual counting or who want to spot long-term health and activity trends. While useful for monitoring, they do not replace professional echocardiography, which remains the "gold standard" for diagnosis.

### 2.3 Base Facts

Key Clinical Metrics (Cheat Sheet)A. Respiratory (SRR)Normal: 15–30 bpm (typically 15–25).Concern: Consistent >30 bpm or a 20% rise from the pet's unique baseline.Urgent: 40 bpm or higher (Emergency).B. RadiographicsVHS (Dogs): 8.4–10.5 (Normal).1 >10.5 (Enlargement).VLAS (Dogs): <2.3 (Normal). >2.5 (Borderline). >3.0 (Severe).VHS (Cats): 6.9–8.1 (Lat). 7.3–9.1 (VD).C. Formulas (LaTeX)LVIDdn: 2$LVIDdn = \frac{LVIDd(cm)}{Weight(kg)^{0.294}}$

## 3. Content Structure Templates

### 3.1 Standard Educational Video Template

Typical descriptive video:

* Introduction
* Disease description
* Diagnosis
* Treatment Options
* Monitoring and advice
* Summary
Signature Elements & Vocabulary
The River Analogy: Laminar vs. Turbulent flow (smooth river vs. rapids).

Standard Phrases:

"A heart murmur is a diagnostic clue, not a diagnosis."

"Is it serious? Should you be worried?"

"Partnership with your vet."

Tech Stack: Cardalis (App), Maven Pet (Wearable - emphasize it's a trend-tracker, not a medical diagnostic), AliveCor (ECG).

### 3.2 Case-Based Videos Template

Case-Based Content Structure (The Bella Template)
Use this structure for case studies to maintain consistency:The Signalment: Name, age, breed, and typical personality (e.g., "Bella, 10y CKCS").Early Signs (The "Red Flags"): Morning cough, restless nights, slowing on walks.The Clinical Exam: Murmur grade (1-6) and heart rate (acknowledging clinic anxiety/stress).Diagnostics:Echo: Focus on valve prolapse, regurgitation, and atrial/ventricle enlargement.Doppler: Mention flow speeds and "raised filling pressures."X-rays: "Silhouette" view to confirm pulmonary oedema ($VHS$ / $VLAS$ metrics).Lung Ultrasound: Mention "B-lines."The Diagnosis: Specific ACVIM stage (e.g., "Stage C DMVD").The Stabilization: Diuretics (Furosemide), Pimobendan, Oxygen.The Home Plan: SRR tracking and activity logs

### 3.3 Short-Form Content Guidelines

None Yet

### 3.4 Website and Blog

Website: [https://www.vetcardiohub.com](https://www.vetcardiohub.com)

Table Class: .smart-table2 (wrapped in .table-scroll-wrapper).

Mobile Font: 12px-14px for tables.

Primary Colours: Deep Blue (#16325F), Teal (#0a9396).

**Technical Design Patterns**
While the provided sources do not contain the raw CSS/HTML code, the document structure reveals the following "Smart" layouts and design preferences for the VetCardioHub digital platform:

*   **Responsive Information Modules:** The site prioritises "Action Plan" downloads for both dogs and cats, appearing as prominent calls to action (CTAs) in the resources section.
*   **Video Integration:** Latest videos are featured prominently on the homepage with an "About" summary that emphasises clear, expert-led education.
*   **Sectional Layouts:** Content is divided into high-level categories: Home, About, Videos, Monitoring, Blog, and Resources (including specific sub-sections for Vets like an "Echo Calculator").
*   **Visual Communication:** Preference for "Before and After" diagrams for heart muscle cells and animated charts for clinical trial data (e.g., RAPACAT trial).

## 4. Branding Guidelines
Pet peeves - aka Dave factor - Not keen on the term 'pet parent' - use sparingly. Not overly keen on use of ACE inhibitors, evidence is severely lacking for effectiveness. Need to be careful with complexities of frusemide, furosemide and lasix. Also the torasemide and torsemide confusions. Particularly keen to encourage importance of monitoring at home via SRR and tracking collars, also the importance of spotting dogs in DMVD B2 to make sure they benefit from pimobendan at the right stages.

Diagnosis over Guesswork: Symptoms alone are insufficient. An echocardiogram is mandatory for accurate staging.

Staging: Strictly follow ACVIM guidelines (B1, B2, C, D).

The SRR Gold Standard: Sleeping Respiratory Rate (SRR) is the single most reliable home-monitoring tool for CHF.

Pillar of Partnership: The owner's role at home (monitoring SRR, activity, and appetite) is as critical as the clinician’s role in the hospital.
