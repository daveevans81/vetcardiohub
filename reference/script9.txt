Intro / Hook
Has your vet mentioned a heart murmur or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
—usually shortened to HCM
—in your cat?

It sounds scary, 
but let’s break down what this really means, 
how it’s diagnosed, 
and what you can do to help your cat live their best life.

HCM in cats is one of the most important
—and often misunderstood—
conditions in feline medicine.
 It can be tricky to get your head around, 
but it’s surprisingly common.

Studies suggest that as many as one in seven cats 
may have some degree of HCM.
The good news? Only a small number ever develop serious symptoms.

This is a disease that exists on a wide spectrum—
from cats who remain completely unaffected for life, 
to those who sadly develop life-threatening heart disease.

I'll explain the staging system vets use to guide treatment -
so you'll know what terms like 'stage B2' actually mean.



So here’s a typical example. 
Luna comes into the vet’s for a vaccination and check up, 
no concerns at all. 
Five years old. Playful, healthy, the queen of her household.

But during her exam, the vet hears something unexpected…
a faint heart murmur. Barely a whisper.
That tiny sound changes everything.

Here’s the twist:
Many people think ‘no murmur means no heart problem’,
or that a quiet murmur must mean a mild problem.
Both are myths.
Today we’re going to uncover the truth about 
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, or HCM—
the most common heart disease in cats and one of the hardest to spot.

Step one is understanding what is going on in HCM:


 

Part 1: What is HCM?
HCM is a thickening of the heart muscle. The name hypertrophic just means ‘thick’. And ‘cardiomyopathy’ literally means ‘heart muscle disease’

This thick muscle becomes stiff and less elastic, 
That makes it harder for the heart to relax 
and it struggles to pump blood efficiently.

It also takes up space inside the heart’s chambers—
like a room where the walls have thickened and the space inside has shrunk.

We can see this in the animation. 
The left ventricle is the hearts powerhouse, 
doing all the work pumping blood right around the body. 
It gets no rest, 
and so defects in the muscle add up more here than anywhere else.

So now we get a very small heart chamber 
unable to fill easily with blood coming in from the left atrium.
Eventually this triggers the left atrium to struggle as well, 
and this is a turning point in the disease. More on this later.


But what causes this thickening?
HCM is genetic in origin.
The heart’s muscle fibres
—tiny filaments of actin and myosin—
are responsible for contracting and relaxing with every heartbeat.

Even a small mutation in the proteins that control these fibres can make the heart muscle less efficient.

Because the heart works constantly and never rests, 
these defects show up here more than anywhere else.

We believe there are many different genetic mutations 
that can all cause the same appearance of heart thickening.
So far only a few have been definitively identified.
Meanwhile in humans with HCM they have found around one thousand!
I think we have a long way to go in veterinary cardiology to catch up.

Some mutations lead to very mild changes that never cause symptoms.
Others cause rapid, severe thickening—even in young cats.

Who Gets It?
Certain breeds have a higher risk, 
including Maine Coons, Ragdolls, and British Shorthairs, 
but HCM can occur in any breed and at any age.
Because it’s genetic, it can run in families.
If a parent, sibling, or littermate has been diagnosed, 
screening your cat
—even if they seem healthy—
is worth discussing with your vet, 

Also this is something you should also strongly consider before breeding.

So going back to Luna’s story, 
we have a situation where a very quiet murmur is present, 
but she seems completely fine. 
What is the best thing to do?

Unfortunately, while it is tempting to ignore the murmur, 
as it is so quiet, this is a dangerous approach.


Not all heart disease makes noise.
In fact, some cats with advanced HCM have completely silent hearts.
The heart muscle thickens, but the blood flow stays smooth, so there’s nothing for a stethoscope to hear.
A perfectly quiet chest does not guarantee a healthy heart.”
(Visual: side-by-side of a normal heart vs thickened wall on ultrasound.)


Also, related to this, is the myth that the loudness of a murmur
Is related to the severity of the disease.
Unfortunately, a heart murmur just
 tells us about the sound of turbulence,
not the severity of disease.

In fact, most cats with a heart murmur are affected by an issue very indirectly related to the muscle thickening. The heart murmur is usually being caused by an obstructive outflow tract issue.

What is that?

Well on this animation you can see how a thickening 
of the upper septum can make it harder for blood 
to get out of the left ventricle during each power stroke. 
We call it a dynamic obstruction, 
because the narrowing worsens during the squeeze. 
When we measure blood flow velocity, 
we see a characteristic spike in flow speed 
as the narrowing gets really bad 
right at the end of the power stroke. 

And this is what causes the murmur in most cats.

So actually it relates to a very specific region of muscle thickening. 
And cats with HCM can show thickening all over the heart
 in a very variable manner. 
Severe thickening at the apex of the heart, 
for example, might be silent. 
While very isolated thickening just at the outflow might be very noisy, 
but might be fairly insignificant clinically. 

 
Part 2: Signs and Symptoms

And does the fact that Luna has no problems 
mean that there is nothing to worry about?


Early HCM is often completely silent clinically. 
No outward signs of problems at all. 
Unfortunately even severe HCM can also be clinically silent.

Unfortunately, many cats give no warning at all.
Some only show subtle clues:
• rapid breathing while resting
• stopping suddenly during play
• occasional open-mouth breathing.
Others appear perfectly normal until a crisis strikes.

One of the most frightening complications is a blood clot,
which can suddenly block blood flow to the back legs—
a painful and life-threatening emergency.

And we still can’t reliably predict which cats are most at risk.”
It is a bit like a ticking time bomb,
and one which can be largely turned off,
by using the right medications 
but only if we know about it. 

The other concerning complication is congestive heart failure, 
Again which many cats are very good at hiding until a crisis has developed.

Because early signs are so hard to spot, 
regular veterinary checkups are vital.
A heart murmur is one of the most useful early clues—but remember, 
not all cats with HCM will have a murmur, 
and not all murmurs mean HCM.


 
Part 3: Diagnosis
Because this disease is so complex and variable, 
it can take some serious detective work to get to the bottom of.

Most investigations start with Stethoscope exam: 
Detecting a murmur is one common reason for investigation,
But also a vet will sometimes hear what’s called a “gallop” rhythm
Or even an arrhythmia. All should raise suspicion.

Blood tests (NT-proBNP) are a good next step. 
These are now available in simple kit form in many countries 
to run ‘in house’ for your vet.

If normal then a severe problem is much less likely. 

This can detect stress on the heart and are useful for screening, especially if a relative has HCM or before anaesthesia.

An Echocardiogram (or ultrasound of the heart) 
is the gold standard and best test by far,
 and the only way to confirm HCM and assess severity.
As a cardiologist, its what I do for every feline patient, 
And without one I am usually just completely guessing.
It’s the biggest piece of the puzzle by far,
And usually gets our detective work most of the way to a resolution.

Are x-rays any good? 
Well, they can show some evidence of heart enlargement 
for a skilled radiologist. 
But x-rays only show a heart in silhouette. 
Like trying to judge the room sizes of a house just from its outline. 
Cat heart muscle changes are often subtle 
and the muscle is thickening inwardly not outwardly. 
So changes are often invisible.

So what happened to Luna?
Her ProBNP blood test showed an abnormal reading.
So she was scanned, and the cardiologist found a thickened heart muscle
Diagnostic for HCM
She also had a large left atrium with poor function and ‘smoke’ present
This is a warning sign for possible clot formation.
This is what we call ‘Stage B2’ 
and you may often hear these stages being used in HCM.
But what do they mean?

HCM stages
So we use a staging system to describe the disease progression. 
This is borrowed from the ACVIM staging system 
originally used to talk about dogs with mitral valve disease.
IT helps understand what treatments to use and how to monitor them best.

A cat with a thick heart muscle but no left atrial changes is in stage B1. 
At this point, as far as well can tell, 
nearly all cats remain completely unaffected 
and never show any problems.

When the muscle thickening starts interfering with the filling process too much, 
the left atrium starts to enlarge. 
This is stage B2. Where Luna is.
A large left atrium is considered to be a major risk factor in the disease 
for developing problems. 
Cardiologists can look for lots of subtle signs on an echo, 
such as smoke formation,
and add them all up to determine the risks 
of getting blood clot development, 
and of going into heart failure.

If they go into heart failure, they enter Stage C. 
This is where the poor filling in the ventricles 
is causing such poor flow 
that back pressure starts building up in the left atrium. 
This back pressure is then responsible for fluid 
starting to leak out, 
both in the lungs 
and sometimes in the spaces around the lungs.
However, we can counteract this tendancy with diuretics, 
usually one called frusemide.

These boost the urine output 
and relieve the congestion and back pressure in the heart and lungs.

And finally stage D occurs, when the back pressure builds up 
Despite a significant level of diuretics being used.
This is a difficult stage, usually higher doses of diuretic are helpful
But not always safe and easy to use in cats. 
Torasemide is a new favourite that is much more potent than frusemide

 
Part 4: Treatment & Management
Currently, there is no cure 
and no proven medication 
to prevent the disease from developing.

However, as you can see from the discussion on stages, 
there are some key steps for intervention.

treatment can:
Control symptoms in advanced stages, such as Stage C and D.
And also reduce risks such as blood clots or heart failure. 
This can be useful from stage B2 onwards

Common medications include:
Beta-blockers to slow the heart rate 
and reduce the tendency to get obstruction in the outflow tract

Anti-clotting medication 
like clopridogrel, rivaroxaban and aspirin 
to help prevent clots

Diuretics if heart failure occurs
And occasionally ACE inhibitors, like benazepril, 
but these are less commonly used these days.

Monitoring is the key:
•	At home: count your cat’s resting breathing rate while sleeping.
Often called the sleeping respiratory rate, we cardiologists love it
because its simple, free, and very effective
Take a look at our video describing it in more detail


•	At the vet: regular checkups and repeat echocardiograms.
Lifestyle adjustments:
•	No special diet is proven to help, though stress reduction is always beneficial.
•	Omega-3 supplements may be considered, but evidence is limited.

Luna was sent home on a new medication to take every day,
Called clopridogrel, it is an anticlotting medication as we mentioned above, 
And stops platelets from sticking together in places they should be doing it.
Platelets are tiny cell fragments in the blood 
and are one of the first steps in forming a clot 
So by inhibiting them we hope to stop clots from forming where they shouldn’t do.

It was also advised that her owners start counting her sleeping respiratory rate, 
or SRR, 
to monitor for any early signs of congestive heart failure starting up. 
She still has a good prognosis and may never tip into heart failure, 
so as long as we manage her risk of blood clots she hopefully will do well.

And thankfully many cats that present this way 
with an incidental murmur 
might even be earlier on in the process 
and may not need anti-clotting medication either.
 
 
Part 5: Prognosis
HCM is one of the most variable conditions in veterinary cardiology:
•	Some cats live normal lifespans without ever showing symptoms.
•	Others develop mild to moderate disease that remains stable for years.
•	A small number develop severe, 
life-threatening disease, sometimes at a young age.

Early detection offers the best chance to manage risk a
nd keep your cat comfortable.
Discuss this in detail with your cardiologist, 
but remember without an echo it is all complete guesswork unfortunately, 
as we can’t diagnose the disease or stage it at all.

 
Key Takeaways
1. Don’t panic if your vet hears a murmur.
2. A murmur is a reason to investigate—not a diagnosis or a death sentence.
3. An echocardiogram or at least an NT-proBNP blood test is the next step.
4. Regular checkups and early detection are the most powerful tools to protect your cat’s health.

Because this disease is so complex and variable, 
it can take some serious detective work to get to the bottom of.

Most investigations start with Stethoscope exam and heart auscultation: 
Detecting a murmur is one common reason for investigation,
But also a vet will sometimes hear what’s called a “gallop” rhythm
Or even an arrhythmia. All should raise suspicion.

A large left atrium is considered to be a major risk factor in the disease  for developing problems.

which is spontaneous contrast appearing in the left atrium
which you can see on echo

and they may not need anti-clotting medication at all.
 Finally there is some new medication that is possibly in the pipeline. You may hear things about rapamycin. Have a look at our video on this. And it is certainly a medication to keep an eye on, but we're not recommending it just yet.
