<p>Recently we have seen a huge variety of tracking collars being released on the market for dogs and cats. They variously claim that they can track GPS position, activity, breathing rates, heart rates, drinking levels, itching levels, and sleep.</p>

<p>This all has huge potential benefit for our cardiac patients. It makes me very excited to see these options appearing. However, its going to take a while for information about which ones are great and which ones less effective.</p>

<p>So I'm hoping to keep this page roughly updated as information appears and new devices get developed</p>
  <div class="note">
    <strong>Clinical note:</strong> This summary emphasises published validation where available and practical clinical relevance for monitoring congestive heart failure (CHF). Most consumer devices are adjuncts for trend detection and should never replace diagnostic testing (echo, radiographs, ECG, Holters) or veterinary advice.
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>GPS note:</strong> Many collars are being developed now with GPS tracking ability. However this relies extensively on local phone/data signal stregth, satellite connections, and comes with big battery drains. If you want a collar for this purpose and not health tracking then you are probably better looking at other reviews and make sure they are checking compatibility with where you live. <br><strong>For example, it appears that the Invoxia collar doesn't work well in the UK yet.</strong>

  <h2>Master Summary</h2>

    <p class="small"><strong>Interpretation key:</strong> RR = respiratory rate; HR = heart rate; HRV = heart rate variability. "Validated" means at least one published peer-reviewed or conference validation that compares the device metric to a ground-truth (manual count, ECG, or equivalent) - note that many validations are done in healthy or controlled cohorts rather than in sick/cardic patients.</p>

  <h2>Practical Takeaways</h2>
<p>Key points when interpreting recommending collars (for veterinarians):</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Look at trends, not absolute numbers.</strong> Collars are most useful for showing direction of change over days/weeks. They get lots of data, this then needs sensible interpretation and filtering out the 'noise'.</li>
    <li><strong>SRR remains the single most useful owner-generated metric.</strong> The SRR has been proven time and again to be the best thing to monitor to gauge onset of CHF and effectiveness of diuresis. Devices that offer validated SRR are the most clinically relevant. Meanwhile mean heart rate is also useful but so far only reliably detected using an ambulatory ECG. It is unlikely to be accurately measured on a collar mounted device.</li>
    <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> validation in healthy dogs does not translate to validation in cardiac disease. Collars are adjuncts only. Studies may be coming but so far we only have anecdotal evidence for their use.</li>
    <li><strong>For high-risk or arrhythmic patients, medical-grade monitoring (ECG/Holter, clinic belt monitors) remains necessary.</strong> These devices only only detect heart movement, not the actual electrical activity in the heart. So an arrhythmia can't be detected reliably.</li>
    <li><strong>When recommending devices to owners, include clear user guidance:</strong> consistent placement, baseline period (1-2 weeks), and when to call a vet.</li>
  </ul>
